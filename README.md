## About

I am a fourth year PhD student in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by [Yun S. Song](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/) and [Nir Yosef](https://niryosef.wordpress.com/group/).
Broadly speaking, I work on mathematical and computational biology.
More specifically, I am interested in statistical phylogenetics and its intersection with single-cell biology.
Recently, I have been working on branch length estimation for single-cell phylogenies and on rate matrix estimation, with a focus on scalability.
