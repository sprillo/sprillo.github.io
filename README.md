## About

I am a second year PhD student in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by [Yun S. Song](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/) and [Nir Yosef](https://niryosef.wordpress.com/group/). I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Computational Biology.
